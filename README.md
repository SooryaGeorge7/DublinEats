# **Dublin Eats**

## **Overview**

Dublin Eats is a website designed to allow a user to find and review Restaurants in Dublin. The site features a search function that allows users to search for any Restaurant in Dublin. The restaurants can be viewed according to cuizines. Users will be able to view Restaurant details such as location, price range, etc. Users will also be able to review Restaurants and pin some restaurants page onto their own customizable profile page. Each user needs to sign up to be able to review and search for restaurants. Each user will have a profile page that they would be able to edit once logged in.

## **Project Goals**

This is my fourth portfolio project for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). In this project i aim to demonstrate my goal of showcasing my skills in django , bootstrap etc.

## ### **Libraries Used**
## **Testing**

## **Deployment**

### **GitHub**

This project was developed by forking a specialized [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) which simulates a terminal in the web browser.

1. Click Use this template
2. Name the repository
3. Launch using the Gitpod web extension
4. Pin project in Gitpod workspaces

### **Version Control**

For version control the following steps were made:

For version control the following steps were made:

1. Changes made to files in Gitpod
2. Files made ready for commit with command - git add "filename", or git add . to add all files
3. For the commits the following command was run along with commit description - git commit -m "This is my commit etc"
4. To move the changes to Github the following command was run - git push
5. Alternatively files can be made ready for commit using the Source Control staging area in Gitpod
6. Files were staged and a message describing the commit was made before committing and pushing it to GitHub

### **Cloning the GitHub Repository**

Creating a clone enables you to make a copy of the repository at that point in time - this lets you run a copy of the project locally: This can be done by:

1. Navigating to
2. Clicking on the arrow on the green code button at the top of the list of files
3. Select Local then HTTPS copy the URL it provides to the clipboard
4. Navigate to your code editor of choice and within the terminal change the directory to the location you want to clone the repository to.
5. Type 'git clone' and paste the HTTPS link you copied from GitHub
6. Press enter and git will clone the repository to your local machine

### **Forking the GitHub Repository**

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
